#### Day 93 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Automate Dino Game 
#### Things I Implemented: PyAutoGUI, Image Processing

#### Link to game: chrome://dino
#### I kinda wanted to skipped this one, Its way too tiring to keep guessing the coordinates, not to mention I ended up becoming way too unproductive

#### The code didn't work at all, sometimes the dino jumps, most times, it did not.

#### The concept works, but the code doesn't

#### There are no link to repl.it, since it doesn't work well anyway

#### The highest score I can get: 162

#### I've failed this day:0
