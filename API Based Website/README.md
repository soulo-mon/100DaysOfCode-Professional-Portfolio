#### Day 95 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: API based Website - English Dictionary using Owlbot API
#### Things I Implemented: HTTP Requests, Public APIs, Flask

#### I'm not proud of this, but I'm not really interested in using over the top frontend (since I'm trying to practice my python skills). This project doesn't really require backend web development skill (although its a website), therefore I'm only making sure it implements HTTP Request to a public API and display the result.

#### Since I'm not proud of it, and I think it's kind of a waste of free heroku apps using dummy account. That's why I will not be deploying this website

#### Steps of deployment:
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a virtual environment by typing 'python -m venv env' in the command line
3. Set your interpreter path to the virtual environment path
4. Download all necessary dependencies
5. Run the python file on terminal, and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

#### Thankyou for reading this README, have a nice day
